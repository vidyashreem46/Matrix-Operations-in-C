💻 **Matrix Operations in C**
Matrix Operations in C is a console-based application that demonstrates core mathematical computations using structured programming concepts in C. This project strengthens problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and practical application of programming fundamentals.

🔹 **Features**

Matrix Addition & Subtraction – Handles matrices of the same dimensions efficiently.
Matrix Multiplication – Supports multiplication with compatible dimensions.
Matrix Transpose – Computes the transpose of any matrix.
User-friendly Input & Output – Clear prompts and neatly formatted matrix display.
Modular Code – Functions for each operation for readability, maintainability, and scalability.

🔹 **Skills Demonstrated**

Structured programming with functions and loops
Use of arrays for storing matrices
Algorithmic thinking for matrix operations
Handling user input and validation
Debugging and testing console-based programs

🔹 **Future Improvements (Optional Advanced Features)**

Dynamic memory allocation using pointers for flexible matrix sizes
Determinant calculation, scalar multiplication, and matrix inversion
Enhanced UI with better formatting and input validation
Complexity analysis for each operation

🔹**How It Works**

User chooses the desired matrix operation.
User inputs matrix dimensions and elements.

🔹** Why This Project**

This project demonstrates practical application of C programming concepts in solving real-world mathematical problems. It’s a great way to showcase coding logic, structured programming, and problem-solving ability — key skills for software development internships.

Program performs the operation and displays the result neatly.

Handles errors like incompatible matrix dimensions (future improvement: invalid inputs).
