# Matrix Operations using C

This project implements basic matrix operations using C programming language.
It demonstrates the use of functions and 2D arrays for modular and efficient code.

## Features
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Transpose
- Menu-driven program
- Uses functions for better modularity

## Technologies Used
- C Programming
- 2D Arrays
- Functions

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or copy the source code.
2. Compile the program using GCC:
   gcc matrix.c -o matrix
3. Run the executable:
   ./matrix

## Notes
1. Maximum matrix size supported is 10 × 10.
2. Proper input dimensions are required for matrix multiplication.
3. This project is developed as part of an internship task to demonstrate understanding of matrix operations in C.
